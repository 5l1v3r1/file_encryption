Build this script just to have fun.
The Encrypt.py is to run and Function.py has all the functions that are nescessary to run the program. 

The encryption key is stored in file "keys.csv" you can generate your own key as while. Just remember to decrypt the files with the same key that you used to 
encrypt the files




This script can run through your subfolder if you enter the folder path e.g:
/home/user/Documents
so it will run through all the subfolder in the Documents folder to find the files with any extension that you type.
Use it safely and DON'T USE ON IMPORTANT FILES.

Remember to have fun.


The only requirment is Python3.
For help type: python3 encrypt --help
